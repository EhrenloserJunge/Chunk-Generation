# Chunk-Generation

Create a script and put 3 models inside it. The first one's name is "Chunk Last Layer", second "Cube Storage", third "Finished Chunk". Also create a part inside the script with the name "Root" and the size you want your cubes to be. After that create a folder and name it "Texture Libary", then import all textures from the github and put them into the folder. Last copy the script from github and paste it in the script that hold all the models and textures. The name of the script doesn't matter i named it "Chunk Generation Script". In the script they're many variables. Don't mess with tables (local example = {}) or variables linked to models. You can change the variables for cube size or chunk height and all that stuff. The generation is stored in a function so if you want to generate a chunk you need to type "chunk_generate()". I already did that at the end of the script. If you set everything up you can now press run or play and your chunk will generate. It can take some time by the way!
